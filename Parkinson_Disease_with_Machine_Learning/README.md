# Parkinsonâ€™s Disease

I am currently working with [Rafael Correa Morales](https://github.com/usuariodf) on a project to predict the probability of a person developing Parkinson's disease through their voice characteristics using **Machine Learning** techniques.

The techniques used include:

- Logestic Classification
- Support vector machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K Neighbors Classifier
- XGBoost

Once we complete the study, I will upload the entire project to this folder.
