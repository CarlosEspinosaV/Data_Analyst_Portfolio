# Welcome to my Portfolio

Here you will find projects that I realized throughout my academic period, my free time and in the additional courses I took.

Between the different tools that I used to develop these projects are the following:

 - Python
 - R
 - SQL
 - Excel
 - Access
 - Power Bi
 - Tableu

Please do not hesitate to share with me questions, corrections or suggestions about these projects.
